## Log

### 2026-10-06 — Factory layout
- **Decision:** Ship a copy-paste `.factory/` template: `FACTORY.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `DOCS.md`, `skills/`
- **Why:** Portable across repos and models; process separate from product docs
- **Alternatives:** Root-level files only; heavyweight monorepo factory infra
- **Revisit when:** A target repo already uses `.factory` for something else

### 2026-10-06 — GitHub issues as sole intake
- **Decision:** Factory work = GitHub issues only. CoS chat files issues; open issues start the loop when a watcher/agent picks them up.
- **Why:** Durable, multiplayer, pick-uppable; history out of chat
- **Alternatives:** Chat-as-queue; external tracker as primary
- **Revisit when:** Need a label/filter so not every issue enters the factory

### 2026-10-06 — Coordinator message kicks the production line
- **Decision:** A message to the project coordinator (CoS or similar) is a factory trigger: file/refine a GitHub issue, then hand off to the factory worker (`intake-from-coordinator.md`). Renamed skill from intake-from-cos.
- **Why:** Stakeholder chat should start the line, not only create a dormant issue; still issue-first and multiplayer.
- **Alternatives:** CoS files issue and always stops; chat-as-queue with no GitHub issue.
- **Revisit when:** A project uses labels so only some coordinator asks enter the factory.

### 2026-10-07 — Adopted factory layout in this repo
- **Decision:** Added `.factory/` (FACTORY.md, DECISIONS.md, DOCS.md, skills/) at repo root.
- **Why:** Establishes a portable, model-agnostic process playbook; work items tracked via GitHub issues.
- **Alternatives:** None evaluated; repo is greenfield with no prior process convention.
- **Revisit when:** A README, docs/, or CI config is added — update DOCS.md pointers accordingly.

### 2026-10-07 — Correction: this repo is not greenfield; DOCS.md and role boundaries updated
- **Decision:** Updated `.factory/DOCS.md` to point at real existing paths (README.md, docs/PURPOSE.md, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/REPO_LAYOUT.md, docs/DEV.md, docs/DECISIONS.md, notes/STATUS.md, notes/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md, SECURITY.md, tests/, pyproject.toml, .github/workflows/, and area READMEs). The prior adoption note was wrong to describe the repo as greenfield.
- **Why:** The repo already had full docs, CI, tests, and open issues (merged in from main). DOCS.md must reflect reality so agents can navigate without guessing.
- **Role boundary:** Product/technical ADRs (D-001 … D-007) live in `docs/DECISIONS.md` and are the product source of truth. `.factory/DECISIONS.md` records factory-process decisions only (how we run the loop, intake, coordination). Agents must not conflate the two files.
- **Revisit when:** New top-level docs are added — append rows to DOCS.md rather than editing this entry.

### 2026-10-07 — Liability gates + contributor sketches
- **Decision:** Add `skills/liability-gates.md` and portable sketches (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, PR template, CODEOWNERS example) under `.factory/sketches/`. Factory-loop must follow liability-gates. Not legal advice; does not eliminate liability.
- **Why:** Light-review public factories need machine-readable hard stops (secrets, license, CI, over-claims) and copy-paste diligence artifacts.
- **Alternatives:** Repo-only ad hoc docs; no agent-enforced gates.
- **Revisit when:** Counsel provides project-specific terms, or CLA is chosen over DCO.

### 2026-10-07 — Always sync latest main before factory work
- **Decision:** Factory skills require fetching/updating onto the current default branch before branching or continuing work; cloud agents may have a slightly stale main.
- **Why:** Avoid PRs based on outdated tips and painful rebase conflicts.
- **Alternatives:** Hope the agent environment is fresh; only sync when conflicts appear.
- **Revisit when:** Agent harnesses guarantee up-to-date default branch at start.

### 2026-10-07 — Merge authority: trivial may auto-merge; normal/high need human
- **Decision:** Only **trivial** PRs (typo/docs/comment/playbook-only, no product/behavior change) may be merged by the factory worker after green required CI. **Normal** (features, bugfixes, behavior, any UI) and **high** require a human before merge. Unsure → normal.
- **Why:** Auto-merges on green CI for user-facing work surprised stakeholders; design allows simple stuff to ship without blocking, but product judgment stays human.
- **Alternatives:** Never auto-merge; always auto-merge on green CI.
- **Revisit when:** Branch protection / CODEOWNERS enforce the same split mechanically.

### 2026-10-07 — UI PRs require screenshots
- **Decision:** Any factory PR that changes websites, pages, or UI must attach screenshots on the PR before it is treated as ready / mergeable.
- **Why:** Text diffs under-communicate visual regressions; humans need a fast visual gate.
- **Alternatives:** Optional screenshots; video-only; rely on live preview links alone.
- **Revisit when:** Automated visual regression is wired into CI.

### 2026-10-07 — Post-merge deploy monitoring
- **Decision:** After merge, the factory worker watches deploy/pages/CD on the default branch and opens a fix if it fails; status is commented on the issue.
- **Why:** Green PR CI is not the same as a healthy deployment; walking away after merge leaves broken sites.
- **Alternatives:** Rely only on humans noticing Pages failures; separate deploy-only bot.
- **Revisit when:** Deploy notifications are automatic and always routed to the worker.

### 2026-10-07 — Factory-loop section required on every factory PR
- **Decision:** The GitHub PR template includes a succinct **Factory loop** checklist (intake → triage → spec gate → build → review → verify → product gate → ship/monitor). Factory workers and Cursor agents must fill it on every factory PR so humans can audit process adherence from the PR alone.
- **Why:** Hard to tell from chat whether workers followed the playbook; PR is the durable, multiplayer surface.
- **Alternatives:** Chat-only status updates; separate process ticket per change.
- **Revisit when:** Checklist becomes noise or steps change.

### 2026-10-07 — UI screenshots must be in PR Evidence section
- **Decision:** For UI/frontend/website/pages PRs, screenshots must appear in the PR description **Evidence** section (embedded or linked). Screenshots only in a conversation comment do not satisfy the gate.
- **Why:** Comment-only shots are easy for humans to miss when auditing adherence from the PR body.
- **Alternatives:** Allow either body or comment; require attached image files only.
- **Revisit when:** GitHub UX makes comment evidence as visible as the description.

### 2026-10-07 — Chat product-gate approval must update the PR description
- **Decision:** When a human product gate (or similar review) is given in chat or another channel, the factory worker must **edit the PR description** before merging: check **Factory loop step 7 (Product gate)**, set **Human reviewed before merge: yes** (and who), and any other matching review fields. Chat approval alone is not enough — the PR body is the durable audit trail.
- **Why:** Workers were merging after chat "Approved" without reflecting that on the PR; humans auditing the PR later could not see that a product gate happened.
- **Alternatives:** Rely on chat history only; require a GitHub review click instead of chat.
- **Revisit when:** Branch protection requires an approving GitHub review for all normal/high PRs.

### 2026-10-07 — Watch scheduled (cron) workflow runs, not just post-merge deploys
- **Decision:** Factory workers check the latest scheduled workflow runs on the default branch at the start of each session and after merges touching scheduled jobs. A failed run becomes a top-priority bug issue (failing step + log excerpt) and is reported to the human; large duration jumps are flagged.
- **Why:** A daily data job failed and the site silently served stale data; it surfaced only when a human asked about something else. Post-merge deploy watching doesn't cover cron jobs with no PR in flight.
- **Alternatives:** GitHub email notifications only; a separate monitoring bot.
- **Revisit when:** The repo has real alerting on scheduled job failures.

### 2026-10-07 — Model routing table; pin models, cheapest capable first
- **Decision:** Add `MODEL_ROUTING.md`. Workers pick a model at triage from risk class + type of work, pin it on every cloud-agent launch (never Auto), escalate one step at a time, and record the model in the PR body. Cursor Models pool (Composer 2.5, Grok 4.7) first; third-party models only when stuck or for a high-risk second opinion. Other Models exhausted → stay on Cursor Models; Cursor Models exhausted → stop new work and ask the human. Workers never enable on-demand spend.
- **Why:** The Other Models pool hit 100% while Cursor Models sat at 1%, blocking agent launches; model choice was implicit and cost-blind.
- **Alternatives:** Leave everything on Auto; one model for all work.
- **Revisit when:** Plan, pool rules, or model lineup changes.

### 2026-10-07 — Update PR branch onto latest main right before merge; repo setting requires up-to-date branches
- **Decision:** Immediately before any merge (trivial auto-merge, or after the human gate), the worker updates the PR branch onto the latest default branch if it is behind and merges only after required CI is green on that new head commit. PRs are also updated before handing them to the human for review. A clean catch-up keeps prior approval; conflicts or changes to the PR’s own diff/behavior are re-verified and reported to the human (gate re-asked for normal/high). As a second layer, repos enable "Always suggest updating pull request branches" and require branches to be up to date (strict status checks) on the default branch.
- **Why:** PRs were reaching human review, and could be merged, while out of date with main, so CI results no longer described what would actually land.
- **Alternatives:** Rely on the start-of-work sync only; merge queue.
- **Revisit when:** The repo adopts a merge queue or the platform auto-updates branches before merge.
